# NoteTaker

NoteTaker is a project to store useful Notes in a Database.

## How I built it

This project was built with React and TypeScript.
For storing the Notes I use the Firestore database of Firebase.
For styling this project I mainly used Bootstrap.

### Why I built it

The Idea for this project was to store notes of topics that I need to improve in.
Whenever I needed to look something up while programming I just added a Note in this project, so that I have a collection of useful topics for my programming journey.

### Usage

Everyone visiting this project can store notes or search for existing notes.
