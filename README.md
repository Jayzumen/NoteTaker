# NoteTaker

NoteTaker is a project to store useful Notes in a Database.

## How I built it

This project was built with React and TypeScript.
For storing the Notes I use the Firestore database of Firebase.
For styling this project I mainly used Bootstrap.

## Why I built it

The Idea for this project was to store notes of topics that I need to improve in.
Whenever I needed to look something up while programming I just added a Note in this project, so that I have a collection of useful topics for my programming journey.

## Usage

To create a note you need to enter a Title and Markdown text as a description of the note.
If you need to edit the note, you can do so by clicking the edit button on the notepage.
If the note is note useful anymore you can delete it, by clicking the delete button.
Everyone visiting this project can store notes or search for existing notes.
